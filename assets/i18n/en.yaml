When the user executes the delegation or undelegation , the blockchain network will automatically execute the [Withdraw rewards], and this rewards figure is wrapped in the delegation/undelegation transaction record, so rewards record will not be displayed independently;\n3. Regarding withdrawing commission, only the current account is a validator who can withdraw rewards, there will be [withdraw commission] flow records."

  tip_delegation_rule_content: "1. The delegation will not affect the ownership of the user's token;\n2. The blockchain network will generate three parts of revenue: block reward + commission + network fee (miner's fee);\n3. In order to incentivize validators, The blockchain network will allocate part of the principal's revenue (usually 10%, or the percentage set by the verifier) as a commission to the verifier, and share the operation and maintenance costs of the node server. After deducting the commission, the remaining part is delegator's income;\n4. The upper limit of each undelegation quantity is the number of all valid tokens currently delegated (undelegating tokens are not included), and the lower limit is 1 token;\n5. The delegator can undelegate at any time. The undelegation arrival time is currently 30 days, which does not affect the user's ownership, but the delegator cannot perform any valid operation on theundelegating tokens before the arrival;\n6. Each wallet can have up to 7 undelegating records at the same time. Undelegation actions with more than 7 will not succeed. You must wait until the undelegation records are completed before you can continue the undelegation operation;\n7. For the rewards generated by the delegation, you can manually perform the [Receive Rewards] operation, or you can automatically execute the [Receive Rewards] when performing the new [Delegation] or [Undelegation] operation;"
